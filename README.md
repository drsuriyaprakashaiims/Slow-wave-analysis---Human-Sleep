# Slow-wave-analysis---Human-Sleep
MATLAB functions and a few EEGLAB functions have been used in this script to detect and extract slow waves of human sleep.
This script was created for the EEG data matrix (129*450000) in the EEGLAB(MATLAB) workspace. [nb of channels: 129; sampling rate (fs): 250; 30 mins of data]
